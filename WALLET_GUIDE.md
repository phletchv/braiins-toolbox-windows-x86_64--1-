# How to Get ETH in Your Wallet

This guide explains how to receive Ethereum (ETH) in your configured wallet address: `0x8AF9F8d7f71f0625794544DC3aaF36d2c75b60F0`

## Overview

Your Braiins Toolbox is configured to mine Ethereum and send payments to your wallet address. Here's everything you need to know about receiving ETH in your wallet.

## Wallet Address

**Your configured wallet address:** `0x8AF9F8d7f71f0625794544DC3aaF36d2c75b60F0`

This is an Ethereum wallet address that can receive ETH from:
- Mining pool payouts
- Direct transfers from other users
- Exchange withdrawals
- DeFi protocol rewards

## How Mining Payouts Work

### Current Pool Configuration

Your toolbox is configured with multiple pools:

1. **Hiveon Pool** (Primary)
   - URL: `stratum+tcp://eth-us-east1.hiveon.net:4444`
   - Payout threshold: Usually 0.1 ETH
   - Payout frequency: Once threshold is reached

2. **Nanopool** (Backup)
   - URL: `eth-us-east1.nanopool.org:9999`
   - Payout threshold: Usually 0.05 ETH
   - Payout frequency: Once threshold is reached

### Payout Process

1. **Mine ETH**: Your mining hardware contributes to the pool's hashrate
2. **Accumulate Earnings**: Pool tracks your contribution and calculates rewards
3. **Reach Threshold**: Once your earnings reach the pool's minimum payout threshold
4. **Automatic Payout**: Pool automatically sends ETH to your wallet address
5. **Receive ETH**: ETH appears in your wallet (can take 10-30 minutes for confirmations)
